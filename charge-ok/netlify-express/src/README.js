// If you are reading this file, you are probebly wondering why this is here. It's because netlify requires
// conent in two folders, them being functions and src. Backend was moved into functions folder to avoid webpack
// because it just breaks the application and is not needed for backend. However a js file needs to be present in src
// even if it does nothing, hence this file.
